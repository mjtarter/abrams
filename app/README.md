Rapid prototyping with Jekyll.


What you get:
---

1. **Separate Config and Site Files** - Move the files for you site into the app/ folder, to keep all of your config files separate.

2. **Bower Assets** - Bower assets setup to compile into an app/components folder. Just run bower install to get started (comes bundled with jquery and foundation 5)

3. **Jekyll Assets** - Uses jekyll-assets, powered by sprockets, to make asset management similar to rails. Use SASS, SCSS, etc in the stylesheets folder.

4. **Glynn FTP Deploy** - Uses glynn gem for easy deployment to a remote FTP server.
