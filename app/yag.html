			<p>YAG laser capsulotomy is a noninvasive procedure performed on the eye to remove the cloudiness that sometimes develops on the posterior capsule of the lens of the eye after extraction of a cataract. This posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is also referred to as a secondary cataract. PCO formation is an attempt by the eye to make a new lens from remaining lens material. Laser posterior capsulotomy is performed with YAG laser, which uses a wavelength to disrupt the opacification on the posterior lens capsule. The energy emitted from the laser forms a hole in the lens capsule, removing a central area of the opacification.</p>
			<p>Within one to two days after surgery, maximum visual acuity will be attained by almost 99% of patients. Once the opacification is removed, most patients will not need a change in spectacle prescription.</p>
